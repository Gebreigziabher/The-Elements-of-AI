# The-Elements-of-AI
The Elements of AI is a series of free online courses created by Reaktor and the University of Helsinki. We want to encourage as broad a group of people as possible to learn what AI is, what can (and canâ€™t) be done with AI, and how to start creating AI methods. The courses combine theory with practical exercises and can be completed at your own pace.
